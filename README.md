Design for Opensource Cryptocurrency Community Health Insurance Platform

The [OpenCryptoCommunity Health Insurance] goal is to add value to the national health ecosystems by by providing smart-contract functionality to risk-pooling schemes based on national health information systems.  The system will process near instant payments based on claims for medical services, providing analytics and risk algorithms, resulting in increased accountability, scalability and sustainability.

The platform is based on three proven, opensource systems: District Health Information System (DHIS2), Insurance management Information System (IMIS) and Rootstock (RSI).  The combined data from DHIS2 and IMIS will provide the basis for accountability, with RSI providing a simple, smart payments platform.  All systems are opensource and free to use.  

The OpenCryptoCommunity Health Insurance (OPEN.CRYPTO.CHS) is the service linking the three systems for  and an analytic platform that manages budgets, risk and...

The OpenCryptoCHS value added is systems integration of the linkages between health data, claims and financing, and establishing a platform for big data solutions. 

Case management database
    Run an instance of DHIS2 
    Cameroon Org Structure as model
    ICCM data model
    ICCM transactions logged in DHIS2 Event using patient data module
Financial reimbursement database
    Run an instance of IMIS 
    Establish links between DHIS2 and IMIS
    Simplified claims model
    Use ICCM costing data for provider reimbursement
Payment system    
    Root Stock
    Use RSK smart contracts as payment system
    
Modeling and analytics
    Use R Studio for analytics
    Use APIs to batch transact data
    Model 'gaming' and responses
    Costing models and analytics


What problem(s) does this solve?
    Sustainability: merge international, national and community funding
    Decentralization: funding flows at local level are easy, fast and guaranteed
    Data quality: Case reporting is linked to funding flows 
    Risk pooling: Free treatment is facilitated
    Complexity: simplifies the funding flow
    Accountability: Transparent financial flows and analytical tools
    
    
    
Open questions:
    How much supply chain integration?
    Why only iCCM?  Should we start with the PHC level or both? 
    What are the differences between what I am suggesting and health microinsurance? (Everyone is eligible by default; the claims are submitted by the service provider instead of the individual)
